In the project folder (rustlings) we can run:

rustlings watch
This will try to verify the completion of every exercise in a predetermined order (what we think is best for newcomers). 
It will also rerun automatically every time you change a file in the exercises/ directory. If you want to only run it once, you can use:

rustlings verify
This will do the same as watch, but it'll quit after running.

rustlings run myExercise1
In case you want to go by your own order, or want to only verify a single exercise.

rustlings run next
Use this command to run the next unsolved exercise in the course.

rustlings hint myExercise1
In case you get stuck, you can run this command to get a hint for your exercise.

rustlings hint next
You can also get the hint for the next unsolved exercise with this command.

rustlings list
Use this command to check your progress.
